# fastmlx

A lightweight machine learning framework based on [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) with an API inspired by FastEstimator.

This repository contains a minimal implementation sufficient to run the MNIST example in `apphub/mnist.py` and a simple CIFAR-10 variant in `apphub/cifar10.py`.
